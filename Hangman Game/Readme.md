# Hangman Game
This is a simple Hangman game implementation consisting of three Java classes: Main, Data, and Worker.
The game allows players to guess a secret word by inputting individual characters.
The objective is to guess the word correctly within a limited number of attempts.
## Main Class
The Main class contains the entry point of the game. It creates an instance of the Worker class and calls the startTheGame() method to initiate the game.
## Data Class
The Data class holds the game data and settings.
It includes variables for the number of attempts, missing characters, game statistics, and word lists categorized by difficulty level.
## Worker Class
The Worker class contains the core logic of the Hangman game.
It handles player input, game progression, and displays relevant information.
The class utilizes the Scanner class to read input from the user.
